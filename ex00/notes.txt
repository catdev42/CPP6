Hi. So here i have an exerise where i have to convert different types of numbers... 
I get a string 

As this class doesn’t need to store anything at all, it must not be instantiable by users.
Except for char parameters, only the decimal notation will be used.
    - All constructors are private so cannot be instantiated
Is this enough?

Chars:
'c', 'a' ...
If not displayable"
To make things simple, please note that non-displayable characters shouldn’t be used as
inputs. If a conversion to char is not displayable, print an informative message.


Logic o the "convert"
